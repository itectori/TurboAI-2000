# TurboAI-2000

This is a small implementation (aka not optimized) of the Monte-Carlo Tree Search algorithm (MCTS).
This implementation is mostly based on [this paper](https://web.stanford.edu/~surag/posts/alphazero.html), which is a popularization of the AlphaZero's implementation.
On this repository, you can find multiple small games (Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect 4 ...) that the AI can learn by reinforcement.
Fell free to implement your own game!
